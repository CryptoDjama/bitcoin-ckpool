# 🙏 Thanks to @Casraw

Hi @Casraw,

Huge thanks for your open-source ckpool project — I used it as the foundation to build my own self-hosted solo mining pool for Bitcoin.

I’ve added:
- Docker support
- A custom web interface with stats (SPS, workers, best share)
- A Telegram bot for alerts
- Connected ASICs: Antminer S19 (20 units), Antminer T21 (1 unit), Avalon Nano 3S (2 units)

Here’s my repository:  
👉 https://github.com/КриптоДжама/solo-btc-bch-pool

I’d truly appreciate it if you could take a look at my setup and let me know if everything seems correct — or if I’ve missed something important.

I recently upgraded **Bitcoin Core to version 28.1**, and now the interface at **localhost:4000** stopped working.  
I'm willing to wait for the next BTC block, but I’d love to have **your confirmation** that the pool is 100 % properly configured.

Other than that — everything is running great.

Appreciate your work and hope you're doing well!
